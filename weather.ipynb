    "In the root of my repository titled [computer_infrastructure_2024](https://github.com/OCorry/computer_infrastructure_2024), on the Linux command line, I have created a directory (folder) called [data](https://github.com/OCorry/computer_infrastructure_2024/tree/main/data) and within that data directory I have created two subdirectories called [timestamps](https://github.com/OCorry/computer_infrastructure_2024/tree/main/data/timestamps) and [weather](https://github.com/OCorry/computer_infrastructure_2024/tree/main/data/weather). \n",

    " The use of the `-p` after the `mkdir` allowed me to create the [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_file_system)<sup>3</sup> of the parent directory `data` and the the two subdirectories `timestamps` and `weather` all at once rather than having to create the `data` directory first and then create the two subdirectories within it. This is a much more efficient approach, particularly if one is creating a large hierarchy of subdirectories nested within other directories. The `-v` is a verbose option which means that the directories that have been created will display in the terminal so the user can see the directories were created correctly.\n",
