    "In the root of my repository titled [computer_infrastructure_2024](https://github.com/OCorry/computer_infrastructure_2024), on the Linux command line, I have created a directory (folder) called [data](https://github.com/OCorry/computer_infrastructure_2024/tree/main/data) and within that data directory I have created two subdirectories called [timestamps](https://github.com/OCorry/computer_infrastructure_2024/tree/main/data/timestamps) and [weather](https://github.com/OCorry/computer_infrastructure_2024/tree/main/data/weather). \n",

This is a much more efficient approach, particularly if one is creating a large hierarchy of subdirectories nested within other directories. The `-v` is a verbose option which means that the directories that have been created will display in the terminal so the user can see the directories were created correctly.\n",

The file is saved with a default name of *today* as this is the endpoint of the API. This is not the best name for the file, as when the command is run numerous times in the present working directory, it will save the files as *today1*, *today2* and so on. \n",

    "#### <ins>Giving the new JSON file a name</ins>\n",
    "As I mentioned above, the new file containing the data in JSON format is saved with a name *today* by default as this is the endpoint of the API being used The next step of this task is adapt the code so that when the file is created, it has a name that is a timestamp and also is in the format of a .`json` file. The command below shows the complete command to download the data using `wget` on the Met Éireann's API. \n",
    "\n",
    "~~~bash\n",
    "wget -O `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S_athenry.json\"` https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today.\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "**or**\n",
    "~~~bash\n",
    "wget -O $(date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S_athenry_json\") https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today.\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, similar to *Task 4* above, the `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S_athenry_json\"` command must be surrounded by either `backticks (``)` or `$Parentheses $()`so that the date command is run first. The output of the date command is then inputted to the the `-O` command which along with `wget` command, outputs the data from the API into a file named with a timestamp. \n",
    "\n",
    "Giving the files a timestamped name means that if the command is run several times in the present working directory, the files save in the order of time they were executed (which corresponds to being in alphabetical order). The first run file is at the start (or at the top) and the last run file is at the end (or the bottom) as the timestamp starts with the year (2024) which is the biggest date increment and ends with the second which is the smallest increment. This makes for easier sourcing of files and also makes it easier when analysing the data within the timestamped files. "
