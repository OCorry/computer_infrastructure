    "##### <ins>Creating the Directory Structure</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the root of my repository titled [computer_infrastructure_2024](https://github.com/OCorry/computer_infrastructure_2024), on the Linux command line, I have created a directory (folder) called [data](https://github.com/OCorry/computer_infrastructure_2024/tree/main/data) and within that data directory I have created two subdirectories called [timestamps](https://github.com/OCorry/computer_infrastructure_2024/tree/main/data/timestamps) and [weather](https://github.com/OCorry/computer_infrastructure_2024/tree/main/data/weather). \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I have adapted code from [Sandra Henry Stocker, (2023)](https://www.networkworld.com/article/971782/creating-and-removing-directory-structures-on-linux.html#:~:text=Each%20group%20of%20directory%20names,being%20created%20at%20that%20level.&text=You%20can%20add%20as%20many,specifications%20to%20the%20mkdir%20command.)<sup>2</sup> and used the command: `mkdir -pv data/{timestamps,weather}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " The use of the `-p` after the `mkdir` allowed me to create the [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_file_system)<sup>3</sup> of the parent directory **data** and the the two subdirectories **timestamps** and **weather** all at once rather than having to create the **data** directory first and then create the two subdirectories within it. This is a much more efficient approach, particularly if one is creating a large hierarchy of subdirectories nested within other directories. The `-v` is a verbose option which means that the directories that have been created will display in the terminal so the user can see the directories were created correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    " I sourced code from [Zaira Hira, FreeCodeCamp (2023)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/diagrams-as-code-with-mermaid-github-and-vs-code/)<sup>4</sup>, [jojozhuang](https://jojozhuang.github.io/tutorial/mermaid-cheat-sheet/)<sup>5</sup>, [marketplace.visualstudio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CatBraaain.mermaid-comment#:~:text=Comment%20with%20%60%25%25%60%20for,lines%2C%20with%20a%20single%20command.&text=Launch%20VS%20Code%20Quick%20Open,following%20command%2C%20and%20press%20enter)<sup>6</sup> and [github.com (2015)](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/213)<sup>7</sup> to create a visual representation of a hierarchy of directories and files. This visual representation can be found [here](./directory_hierarchy.md). The root directory **A** is the top-most tier of the of the hierarchy and is denoted by a `/` [Wikipedia, (2024)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory)<sup>8</sup>. From the root directory then, stems directory **B** and directory **C** which are subdirectories of the root directory **A**. Directory **B** & **C** are parent directories to directory **D** & **E** respectively but also contain files **A** & **B** respectively. Directories **D** & **E** are subdirectories of **B** & **C** respectively. Directory **D** contains two files called file **C** & file **D**. Directory **E** contains one file called file **E**.\n",

    " ##### <ins>Pushing the Directory Structure to Github</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    " When it came to committing my changes to my Github repository and pushing them to Github, my changes would not push. This is because Git only tracks files and does not track empty directories [Foster. G (2024)](https://graphite.dev/guides/add-empty-dir)<sup>9</sup>, [GeeksforGeeks (2023)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-an-empty-directory-to-a-git-repository/)<sup>10</sup>. As a result, if a directory is created and a file is not inputted into it, the directory will just be ignores and it will not push up to Github.\n",
    "\n",
    " To overcome this, I found that creating a `.gitkeep` file in the **timestamps** and the **weather** directories [Parr. K (2021)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-gitkeep/)<sup>11</sup> would allow me to push up my changes to my Github repository. I used `touch .gitkeep` command to create the the *.gitkeep* file in each of the directories [GeeksforGeeks (2024)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/touch-command-in-linux-with-examples/#1-how-to-create-an-empty-files-by-using-touch-command-in-linux)<sup>12</sup>. This was just a temporary measure just to allow me to complete task 1. I later removed these files from the directories again once I had added other permanent files to them in following tasks. I did this by using the `rm .gitkeep` command [GeeksforGeeks (2024)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rm-command-linux-examples/)<sup>13</sup>."

    "Once in the `timestamps` directory, in the command line, I have used the [date](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/date-command-linux-examples/)<sup>15</sup> command to output the current date and time in the command line (terminal). This prints the date and time in the format: abbreviated day, abbreviated month name, then day of the month and the current time.

The `date` part of the command generates the date as discussed above. The append redirect operator `>>` redirects the output of the `date` command into a new file called `now.txt`. If the `now.txt` file doesn't already exist, the command creates the new file. I have repeated this command 10 times in total and the 10 outputs are saved to the `now.txt` file. It is very important to use the `>>` here rather than a single redirect `>`. If the `>` is used, then it will overwrite all of the data that was in the file prior to running the command with the `>` operator [Damon Garn (2021)](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/redirect-operators-bash#:~:text=The%20append%20%3E%3E%20operator%20adds%20the,uname%20%2Dr%20to%20the%20specifications.)<sup>17</sup>.\n",

The `more` command filters through the file one screenful at a time. If the file is a lengthy one, pressing the space bar on the keyboard will open the next screen of content.

If however, the user was using their own machine and were not located in UTC timezone, the command `date -u` can be used to generate UTC time and date.

Using UTC means that users from different time zones are working on a common ground in terms of time when working with data.\n"
