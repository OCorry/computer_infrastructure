This is a much more efficient approach, particularly if one is creating a large hierarchy of subdirectories nested within other directories. The `-v` is a verbose option which means that the directories that have been created will display in the terminal so the user can see the directories were created correctly.\n",

    "As I mentioned in *Task 5* above, the new file containing the weather data (in JSON format) is saved with a name *today* by default using the `wget` command as this is the endpoint of the API and `wget` saves the file using the file name on the server. In this task, I have adapted the code above so that when the file is created, it is given name which is a timestamp. The `-O` is added to the `wget`command to allow the user to rename the file [Mucuho. C & Lee. R. (2021)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-wget-to-download-files-and-interact-with-rest-apis)<sup>44</sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below shows the complete command used to download the data using `wget -O` command on Met Éireann's API and to save is as a `.json` file. As the data is for a specific area, *Athenry*, I have also added `_athenry` to the filename. \n",
    "\n",
    "~~~bash\n",
    "wget -O `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S_athenry.json\"` https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\n",

    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, similar to *Task 4* above, the `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S_athenry.json\"` command must be surrounded by either `backticks (``)` or `$Parentheses $()`so that the date command is run first. The output of the date command is then inputted to the the `-O` command which along with `wget` command, outputs the data from the API into a file named with a timestamp. \n",
    "\n",
    "Giving the files a timestamped name means that if the command is run several times in the present working directory, the files save in the order of time they were executed (which corresponds to being in alphabetical order). The first run file is at the start (or at the top) and the last run file is at the end (or the bottom) as the timestamp starts with the year (2024) which is the biggest date increment and ends with the area name `_athenry`. This makes for easier sourcing of files and also makes it easier when analysing the data within the timestamped files. \n",

    "`cURL` is a much larger scale option to `wget` and more tasks can be carried out on it. It supports **HTTP** and **FTP** like `wget` but also supports many other protocols [Ludosanu.R (2024)](https://www.warp.dev/terminus/curl-vs-wget)<sup>45</sup>. \n",

    "\n",
    "##### - Renaming the downloaded file using cURL\n",
    "Using the `curl -o` command allows the user to rename the downloaded file via the API to their own desired name. Again the user has the option of using `backticks (``)` or `$Parentheses` `$()` around the `date` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~bash\n",
    "curl  -o `date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S_athenry.json\"` https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today\n",

    "The use of a lowercase `o` rather than an uppercase `O` in the command above is important if the user wants to rename the file being downloaded and saved.

    "Before getting into the write up of this task, I firstly wanted to carry out some research into what a **Bash Shell** and a **Bash Script** are in **Linux** to get myself more familiar with the environment used. From my research, my understanding of these concepts are outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### <ins>What is a **Bash Shell** in Linux?</ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "To get more of an understanding of what a `shell` is in Linux, I sourced some information from [GeeksforGeeks (2024)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-linux-shell-shell-scripting/)<sup>49</sup>, [datacamp (2022)](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/what-is-shell)<sup>50</sup> and [Fisher. T. (2024)](https://www.lifewire.com/guide-to-command-line-interpreters-8734407)<sup>51</sup>. From these sources, I understand that a non graphical `shell` is a program which interprets the commands that the user inputs on the command line interface (terminal) and these are directed to the operating system of the computer. The operating system then processes these commands [Wikipedia (2024)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)<sup>52</sup>. A `Bash (Bourne Again Shell)` then is a type of `shell` program [Klein. M. (2024)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-bash-used-for/)<sup>53</sup>. According to [phoenixNAP Global Services (2024)](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-shells)<sup>54</sup>, there are 8 different types of `Linux Shells`. Of these 8 `Linux Shells`, **Bash** is one of the most common amongst Linux users [software carpentry (2023)](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro.html)<sup>55</sup>, [Kili, A. (2023)](https://www.tecmint.com/different-types-of-linux-shells/)<sup>56</sup> and [wikipedia (2024)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))<sup>57</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### <ins>What is a **Bash Script** in Linux?</ins>\n",
    "A `Bash Script` is a text file containing a command or series of commands. Any commands that can be run directly on the command line interface can be put into a `script` and it will produce the same result as if it was run manually by the user on the command line [datacamp (2022)](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/how-to-write-bash-script-tutorial)<sup>58</sup>. Repetitive tasks can be put into a `script` and can be automated so that the user does not need to carry out long tedious tasks manually - instead the pre-written `script` is run. Scripting is very useful for automating routine tasks [GeeksforGeeks (2024)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bash-scripting-introduction-to-bash-and-bash-scripting/?ref=header_outind#applications-of-bash-scripts) <sup>59</sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of a **Bash Script** always contains a `shebang` which is a combination of `bash #` and `bang !`. This creates an absolute path to the **bash interpreter** [Hira. Z(2022)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/shell-scripting-crash-course-how-to-write-bash-scripts-in-linux/#:~:text=Shell%20scripting%20is%20an%20important,certain%20commands%20again%20and%20again.)<sup>60</sup> and consequently tells the operating system which shell interpreter to use [tutorialspoint (2024)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/using-shebang-hash-in-linux-scripts#:~:text=On%20Linux%2C%20a%20shebang%20(%23,the%20path%20to%20the%20interpreter.))<sup>61</sup> (which will be **Bash** for this task)."

    "The first step of this task was to create a `weather.sh` script in the **root** of my repository. To do this, I have used the `nano` Text Editor [GeeksforGeeks (2024)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nano-text-editor-in-linux/)<sup>62</sup>. In the command line interface I used the following command to create the new file:\n",

    "Because the `weather.sh` script and the `data` folder are both in the **root** of the repository, adding `data/weather` ahead of the `date` command redirects the output of the script to the `weather` directory because the `weather` directory is a subdirectory of the `data` directory.\n",

    "3) Redirects the data to the `data/weather` directory.\n",

    "However, the script is not yet in executable format meaning that it is a program that cannot be run. In Codespaces, if we run the `ls -al` command in the **root** repository (/workspaces/computer_infrastructure_2024), the following output is presented in the terminal:\n",
